<h1>YCH:FAQ</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Why is my account banned?</strong></h2>
<p>You can see the <strong>reason and duration</strong> of the suspension on the site when you're trying to login.</p>
<p>To get additional information on why your account got suspended, you can look for reports on your auctions after the suspension expired.</p>
<p>We do our best to make sure that nobody gets banned without doing proper due diligence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your account it suspended for <strong>untagged adult content</strong>, we recommend to have a look at the <a href="/content_rating">content rating</a> guide before sending a mail. Most important is, that offering NSFW or nude artwork requires an auction to be tagged explicit, which is the most common reason for account suspension.</p>
<p>To know more about <strong>base rule violation</strong>, please have a look at the <a href="/auction_guidelines">auction guidelines</a>, Rules for bases section.</p>
<p>If your account was suspended for <strong>art theft, traced artwork or impersonation</strong> and it was a mistake, please reach out to us, include your account name and add proof, that you are the original artist. For proof, we recommend sending us a link to your existing portfolio, Deviantart, Furaffinity, Twitter, Artstation or similar.</p>
<p>Sometimes we ask you to <strong>contact support</strong>. Please do so as soon as possible, because we need more information about a situation to resolve it swiftly. You can find contact information on our <a href="http://wiki.commishes.com/en/contact"><u>contact page</u></a>.</p>
<p>Of course there can be other reasons for suspensions too, we try to give you as many information as possible in the note of the suspension, if you still have no clue, you may contact us.</p>
<p>To learn more about the reasons why accounts get suspended, please take a look at <a href="/suspension"><u>suspension information</u></a>.</p>
<p><i>Please note, that emails sometimes takes a few days to reply. If your suspension is shorter than a week, we appreciate you being patient and waiting for the suspension to expire on it's own.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What is untagged adult content? Why was my account suspended?</h2>
<p>When you upload artwork to YCH you need to be very mindful of our <a href="/content_rating">Content Rating</a> policy. If you uploaded anything as safe or questionable that requires an explicit rating on our website, we will suspend your account for violating these rules. When offering content in the descripton of your auction, that doesn't fit the rating of the image you're using, you still have to tag it based on the highest content level you're offering. This means that offering NSFW versions of your auction requires you to mark it as explicit.</p>
<p>Remember <strong>covering your adult content with black censor bars or stickers does not make it safe</strong>. You are not required to add them, just to tag your stuff properly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Why got my auction reported? / The report on my auction is false!</h2>
<p>You can check if the report is still open (#Pending) or already closed (#Resolved).</p>
<p>If the report is already marked as #Resolved, you don‘t have to do anything. A moderator already reviewed it, the report is no longer active.</p>
<p>If the report is still open you have the option to edit the auction and to fix the possible rule violation. For example: if your auction is reported for <a href="/content_rating"><strong><u>untagged adult content</u></strong></a> you can change the rating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then, please wait for a moderator to review your report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>I can't find my auction!</strong></h2>
<p>Please check your <a href="https://ych.commishes.com/settings/display/"><u>auction display settings.</u></a> You need to allow adult content to be able to see it.</p>
<p>We do not delete auctions without a reason, so you might also check for reports on your auctions.&nbsp;Possible reasons to delete an auctions are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>- wrong category</li>
  <li>- double sale of adoptables</li>
  <li>- stolen content</li>
  <li>- impersonation</li>
  <li>- spam</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>I can't find my portfolio submission!</strong></h2>
<p>Please check your <a href="https://portfolio.commishes.com/settings/">portfolio display settings</a>. You need to allow adult content to be able to see it.</p>
<p>As for now, we only delete portfolio content that falls under illegal content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How do I receive/get rid of badges</h2>
<p>Badges are not permanent and are standing for certain things you've achieved with your account.</p>
<p>The <mark class="marker-pink">new member</mark> badge will disappear after your account is three month old.</p>
<p>The <mark class="marker-pink">spammer</mark> badge will disappear after you've started less than 40 auctions within a <strong>time frame</strong> of thirty days.</p>
<p>There are three badges you can archieve by finishing auctions. To count, the auctions have to received <a href="https://loot.commishes.com/"><u>feedback.</u></a><br>To reveive feedback, you have to upload the finished artwork, or a preview/placeolder, with the “Upload result” link next to your auctions.&nbsp;</p>
<p><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>Proficient</strong></mark><strong> requires 10, </strong><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>Workhorse</strong></mark><strong> 50 and </strong><mark class="marker-yellow"><strong>Unstoppable</strong></mark><strong> 100 feedbacks. </strong>The bages count for the time-frame of 365 days, which means they can disappear again.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>I paid for a promotion </strong>but my auction is not in the featured section?!</h2>
<p>A promotion does not push your auction into the featured section instantly and is no guarantee that it will end up there.</p>
<p>Promoting an auction gives it a boost over how it would be positioned naturally and their effect will increase over time.</p>
<p>if you can't find your auction in the auctions list, please check your <a href="https://ych.commishes.com/settings/display/"><u>display settings</u></a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When something really went wrong with your promotion, please<a href="https://wiki.commishes.com/en/contact"> contact support</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>I've already sent a message</strong>.. but still don't have an answer.</h2>
<p>Please be patient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We receive many emails and have a lot to do so it might take a few days till we're able to reply to your issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you need assistance as soon as possible, please check for other ways to <a href="/contact"><u>contact us</u></a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Can I remove a bid?</strong></h2>
<p>It's not possible to remove a bid you've placed on an auction by yourself. If you want to withdraw from an auction, you have to ask the seller of the auction if they are willing to remove your bid. Contact Administration only when your bid was a typo and the seller won't respond to you.</p>
<p>If you've received an unwanted bid, you can simply remove it any time. To do so, go to your <a href="https://ych.commishes.com/account/"><u>account menu</u></a> and to the bid list, next to the auction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>I can't see my auction listed. / Why can't I see adult content on YCH?</h2>
<p>If you can't find your auction or submission, it's very likely that it's tagged explicit or questionable, and you do not allow it. Adult content needs to be opted into, wich is really easy to do.</p>
<p>We have different display options for <a href="https://portfolio.commishes.com/settings/rating/"><u>portfolio</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://ych.commishes.com/settings/display/"><u>auctions</u></a>. In the auction display settings, you can also chose to hide adult and questionable content, but still be able to access it by clicking on the thumbnails.</p>
<p>You need to be logged in to change your settings, guests cannot list adult auctions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Can I have a second account? / Are multiple accounts okay?</h2>
<p>Yes, it's generally allowed to have multiple accounts on Commishes. However, due to technical reasons, <strong>it is not recommended</strong> to have multiple accounts on commishes.</p>
<p>There's many legitimate reasons why one would own multiple accounts. You can, for example, have a separate account for your adult artwork, for different fandoms, or different creative outputs like painting and crafting.</p>
<p>The exception to this rule is registering (or owning) accounts to avoid a suspension, to manipulate the bidding system or to deceive other users. If one of your accounts was suspended for a rule violation (regardless of what kind) you are not allowed to use any of your other accounts or register a new one. <strong>Creating a new account because you've been suspended/banned, will result in a permanent ban</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How many auctions am I allowed to submit?</h2>
<p>There is not an absolute limit in the number of auctions you can run at the same time, as long as these auctions are relevant to the interest of the audience of Commishes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Aggressive posting, as in posting to the wrong categories or with minor edits repeatedly and abusively, will lead to your account being suspended for spam.&nbsp;Please check the rules for <a href="https://wiki.commishes.com/en/rules#h-25-auction-posting-limits">auction posting limits</a> for more details.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Can I delete my account?</strong></h2>
<p>Accounts can only be deleted by administration.</p>
<p>If you want your account to be deleted, please send a mail to: patch@commishes.com and state your username and the e-mail address your account has been registered with.</p>
<p><strong>Please have patience, it will most likely take a few days for deleting requests to be processed and a few weeks until the account will be fully deleted.</strong></p>
<p>We reserve the right not to delete accounts that are banned for violating the rules or other proper reasons.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>How do I mark an auction as finished/ how do I receive feedback/reputation?</h2>
<p>To receive feedback and let the site know that you've finished an auction, you have to go to <a href="https://ych.commishes.com/account/">my account</a> and send the picture via the “Upload result” link.</p>
<p>Your client will then receive a link where they can leave the <a href="https://loot.commishes.com/">feedback</a>.</p>
<p>To mark the auction as finished, so it won't show up in your open Commissions counter anymore, you have to choose “finished” in the Folder dropdown on the upper right side.</p>
