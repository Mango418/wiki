<p>If you're joining this site you should make yourself familiar with the rules of commishes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's your responsibility to fully review and understand the rules. Not knowing or not understanding any of the rules is no excuse for breaking them and all rule braking will be handled the same, whether intentional or not.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not sure what a rule means, do not understand it, or not sure if something breaks a rule, feel free to ask. You can get help with the rules on any of our <a href="https://ych.commishes.com/home/help/ ">support channels.</a></p>
<p>An offense to any of these rules, intentional or unintentional, can lead to consequences, such as suspensions, auction cancelling or total ban from the site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admins and Moderators are not required to announce a warning before a penalty takes effect If you find any inappropriate content or any other rule violations on the site, please report it.</p>
<h1>1. Behavior</h1>
<p>As a user of Commishes, you are expected to treat others appropriately and with respect. Polite interaction, even in the case of disagreements, is required. It is always possible, and recommended, to consult a moderator to avoid escalation.</p>
<h2>1.1 Harassment</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Targeting another user in any way with the intent of causing disruption of their peaceful use of the site is not allowed and depending on severity may result in a lengthy or permanent ban.</li>
  <li>Misusing the site in order to harass another user incurs both a strike for harassment, and a strike for whatever other rules were broken during the harassment, such as fake bids or alt accounts.</li>
  <li>Expressing non-constructive negative opinions toward a bidder, artist, bid amount, auction price, amount of artwork, offsite transgressions, or art quality is not allowed and may result in a minor strike. This list is non-exhaustive. This does not necessarily apply when the artist explicitly requests critique, or for artwork you've purchased. See section <i>6.4 Critiquing and leaving feedback</i></li>
  <li>Actions taken toward a user, even if the user is suspected of breaking the rules, may still count as harassment. The severity of the punishment and whether there is punishment at all is a case-by-case basis. Please refrain from attempting to use vigilante justice for your own account safety. Report them instead. For emergencies such as impersonation, please PM a moderator or preferably an admin directly.</li>
  <li>Using private messages, replies, or comments to ask for favors, money, or to advertise is not allowed and will result in a strike.</li>
  <li>Posting content which is targeted toward a specific group of people with intent to cause a disturbance in said group is considered harassment. Intent is at the discretion of the admins.</li>
</ol>
<h2>1.2 Private interactions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Private interactions are not passively moderated until a user within the interaction reports the private message to the moderation team. If a moderator is present and able to read the PM, their name will appear on the right.</li>
  <li>The same content and behavior guidelines apply in private messages.</li>
</ol>
<h2>1.3 Reporting content</h2>
<ol>
  <li>There are several avenues to report content, each with their own turnaround time.<ul>
      <li>For emergencies, such as high level impersonation or similar, you may private message an admin from our <a href="https://discord.gg/tzPQHcW">Discord server</a>. Do not private message admins for any other reason unless asked to.</li>
      <li>For auctions breaking guidelines, it is recommended to use the site's built-in reporting feature. Older reports take precedence, reports are handled in the order they're received.</li>
      <li>For fastest response, it is recommended to either post in the #support channel of our <a href="https://discord.gg/tzPQHcW">Discord server</a>, or our <a href="https://t.me/joinchat/QF2m1w4fMu6xcSlJ">Telegram chat</a>. More important reports take precedence, so your report or question may be buried.</li>
      <li>For general inquiries or time-insensitive report issues, you can email patch@commishes.com</li>
      <li>For site bug reports, please read <a href="/bug_reports">reporting bugs</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Report content you believe breaks any of the rules of this page. For faster handling of the report, please leave as much evidence as possible or your report may be discarded.</li>
  <li>Multiple reports which lead nowhere may result in the reporter receiving a strike for false reporting.</li>
  <li>If reports are seemingly targeted, and are used in a way to attempt to prevent a user from hosting an auction peacefully, a ‘false report’ strike and a ‘harassment’ strike may be given simultaneously.</li>
  <li>Stolen content reports or traced artwork reports must provide proof or they will be thrown out. If you are an artist and would like the ‘stolen content’ banner removed, contact an administrator and we will remove it if the reporter has provided no evidence. This is faster than waiting for the report to come through our queue.</li>
  <li>If you have a general inquiry or ban appeal, see section <i>2.8 Appealing bans.</i></li>
</ol>
<h2>1.4 Indecent or illegal content</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Commishes takes a hands-off approach to moderating content that is not targeted harassment or illegal. We are currently developing a way to block specific content you don't wish to see.</li>
  <li>Commishes servers are based in Germany, and abide by Germany law. This includes two major restrictions on content that we enforce:<ul>
      <li>Questionable or explicit depictions of humans who appear under the age of 18 or are said to be under 18 are not allowed. This does not apply to non-humans. Species such as elves where they are primarily human-looking are considered to be human and this rule does apply to them.</li>
      <li>Depictions of Nazi symbols, medallions, uniforms, or slogans are illegal in Germany and are thus not allowed to be posted on Commishes.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>While not outlawed explicitly by law, to be on the safe side we don't allow realistic depictions of humans or mainly human-like creatures such as elves being depicted having sex or forcing themselves sexually on a non-sentient non-fictional creature. Stylized pictures or ones not attempting to mimic a realistic style remain allowed.</li>
  <li>Due to the negative impact on the art community as a whole, NFTs are not allowed on Commishes.</li>
</ol>
<h2>1.5 Micromodding and vigilante justice</h2>
<ol>
  <li>The only tool available to users to help moderate the site is their ability to report content that violates rules. This includes the support chats, and the on-site reporting feature. Using any function of the site to get 'vigilante' justice may result in your account being temporarily suspended. This includes but is not limited to:<ul>
      <li>Bidding large amounts on an artist's auction to prevent them from receiving bids from others</li>
      <li>Commenting on an artist's posts to ‘warn’ others, even if what you're saying is true.</li>
      <li>Reporting all of an artist's auctions because of something unrelated to the auctions</li>
      <li>Contacting winners of auctions directly through any means in order to attempt to dissuade them from purchasing the auction.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Sharing your experiences with an artist, even negative is fully allowed under two conditions.<ol>
      <li>You may not word your review in a way that could be considered harassing or derogatory. Be concise, not angry.</li>
      <li>You may not place your review as a reply or comment on the artist themselves' posts, but you may link to said posts.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>1.6 Tracing, stealing, and copying</h2>
<p>There is a fine line between what is considered derivative and what is considered stealing and/or tracing. This section covers what they mean and what their repercussions are.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Tracing is not allowed on Commishes. This means any auction who's lines are, in part or whole, too similar to a previously existing artwork will not be allowed. <strong>This will result in an immediate permanent ban.</strong> Appeals will only be considered if the tracing is minor and the user has a good track record.</li>
  <li>Stealing images directly in any form is not allowed and will result in a permanent ban.</li>
  <li>Art styles, poses, original species, and ideas are not considered defensible property so long as they do not violate the tracing rules.</li>
</ol>
<h2>1.7 Ban evasion</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Posting new auctions on a second account ( including an otherwise allowed alternate account ) when any of your accounts are banned or suspended, is considered ban evasion and may result in a <strong>permanent ban</strong> for all accounts.</li>
  <li>If you have been banned for 72 hours or longer and wish to continue communication with a commissioner on CRM, you may contact support to receive temporary access to a thread while waiting out your ban. To be sure you receive the fastest assistance, please include the <strong>link to the auction</strong> or the <strong>CRM thread</strong> as well as <strong>your email</strong>. We will send an invite to the thread to your email, you're allowed to PM a moderator privately for this request. You will not be allowed to contact a commissioner of an auction which was removed for any content guideline violation such as tracing, character stealing, etc, as this auction is considered illegitimate.</li>
</ol>
<h1>2. The site</h1>
<h2>2.1 The content rating system</h2>
<p>The content rating system is in place to allow users to broadly and easily block content they don't wish to see or should not be allowed to see. By default, users are limited to viewing ‘safe’ auctions.&nbsp;Ratings for auctions also include any potential edits, and links in the description.</p>
<ol>
  <li>You must be 18 or over to view or post any auction over the ‘safe’ rating. Circumventing this will be a permanent ban.</li>
  <li>The rating system is as follows. Marking an auction as a lower rating is grounds for a ban equal to the severity of the rating disparity. Marking as ‘questionable’ when it should be ‘explicit’ is grounds for a warning or 24 hour suspension for first offense, but marking an auction as safe when it should be ‘explicit’ or 'shock' can be a 72 hour, week, or permanent ban. When in doubt, there's currently no punishment for rating an image higher than it is. You may also ask an admin on our support chats.<ul>
      <li><strong>Safe: </strong>Safe auctions are considered entirely kid friendly. This means:<ol>
          <li>No genitals. This includes feral animal sheaths, comical “X” anuses, and female nipples.</li>
          <li>No outlines of genitals, even vaguely. Including through clothes.</li>
          <li>No implication or indication of sex having had happened, happening, or going to happen.</li>
          <li>No vulgar language.</li>
          <li>No blood or horror-themed images designed to be creepy or scare users.</li>
          <li>Main camera focus must not be on a traditionally erotic section of the body, even if fully clothed.</li>
          <li>No obvious fetishes of any kind, sexual or not.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Questionable:</strong> Questionable pics are pictures designed to be erotic, suggestive or edgy, without going full porn. This means<ol>
          <li>Nudity is fine so long as no reproductive genitals or anuses are seen.</li>
          <li>Large breasts or butts are fine if not being used/touched sexually.</li>
          <li>Horror themed images designed to be creepy or scare users, no blood.</li>
          <li>Comical genitals such as bathroom stall drawings of penises or “X” anuses, which are not erotic.</li>
          <li>Implied sex through dialogue or facial expression only.</li>
          <li>Artistic Bondage/Shibari, as long as no genitals are visible.</li>
          <li>Candy gore</li>
          <li>Nude characters who are ‘conveniently censored’ such as a tree branch blocking their genitals.<i> Please remember if you offer an ‘uncensored’ version that it counts as explicit.</i></li>
          <li>Recreational drug use such as alcohol or marijuana.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Explicit: </strong>Hardcore porn that a majority of adults would not find gratuitous and censored previews of the artwork. This includes:<ol>
          <li>Exposed female nipples.</li>
          <li>Bulges, camel toes, latex, and other tight fitting clothing that show the shape of the genitals below.</li>
          <li>Any visible reproductive genitals or anus.</li>
          <li>Sex, including ‘x-ray’ of egg/sperm</li>
          <li>Sexual fluids</li>
          <li>Erotic groping or rubbing (such as foreplay), masturbation, and use of toys which are designed to deliver sexual pleasure.</li>
          <li>Fetishes involving sexual contact.</li>
          <li>Terms that refer to anything sexual, including ahegao, MILF, trap, futa..</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Shock:</strong> Any image that is far outside of what is considered normal, but not disallowed by the site rules in <i>1.4 Indecent or illegal content. </i>This includes, but is not limited to:<ol>
          <li>Gore, blood, death, digestion, torture.</li>
          <li>Wounds that are inflicted by a weapon. Actual organs and bones (Such as intestines, lungs, anatomically correct heart)</li>
          <li>Anything the average person would consider ‘gross’ such as scat, watersports, filth, farts, poor hygiene, and diapers.</li>
          <li>Cub and non-human characters that appear or are implied to be younger than 18. Please remember human-like characters under 18 are not allowed per <i>1.4 Indecent or illegal content.</i></li>
          <li>Bestiality, which on this site is currently defined as ‘sexual acts involving a non-sentient creature.’</li>
          <li>Rape</li>
          <li>Non-recreational drug use.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>2.2 Profile pictures and banners</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Profile pictures and banners across the entire site must fit the criteria for a <strong>safe</strong> image as explained in <i>2.1 The content rating system.</i></li>
  <li>Do not steal another user's avatar or banner.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2.3 Alt or multiple accounts</h2>
<p>Multiple accounts are useful for several reasons, but have many responsibilities. Please follow these rules to ensure you don't end up getting action taken against your accounts:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Alt account must have a defined reason if asked, such as to separate NSFW and SFW artwork, or to separate adoptables from auctions.</li>
  <li>You are not allowed to post auctions on a new account while you still have older artwork to deliver on your main. Finish all necessary artwork, then post new artwork. If you post new auctions and stopped responding to older ones, staff may believe you are evading work and scamming people and take action against you.</li>
  <li>You are not allowed to post new auctions on alt accounts if you are banned or suspended on any of your other accounts. This is to prevent circumventing bans by moving auctions to another account. If you do so, you may be hit with a ban-evasion ban, which is permanent.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2.4 Collaborative accounts</h2>
<p>Collaborative or ‘joint’ accounts are allowed with several rules:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If the joint account violates any rules, all users who are a part of the group are punished equally on their main accounts if they have them. As such, it's highly recommended to be safe about who you share accounts with or who you let post your art.</li>
  <li>Any auctions the joint account posts must list the original artist, and a method to contact them directly.</li>
  <li>If a joint account posts artwork from a user who has been banned or is currently suspended, this is counted as ban evasion and has the same punishment as ban evasion. It is highly recommended to vet users you host art for.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2.5 Auction posting limits</h2>
<p>While there is no limit to the number of concurrent auctions you may have running, it's safe to keep in mind the implications of doing so:&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
  <li>Any auctions which ends or gets canceled before selling it will lower your score as an artist, and your future auctions will not be shown to as many people.</li>
  <li>Having over about 5 auctions at the same time will degrade your score for each auction, and they will be shown to less people.</li>
  <li>Having to deal with that many auctions simultaneously can be overwhelming, be sure you only take on as much work as you can handle.</li>
</ol>
<p>Multiple auctions can be posted so long as they follow these rules:</p>
<ol>
  <li>They are not identical. i.e. a clone auction with multible slots. You can only post one of these at a time. We suggest setting the starting bid and autobuy to be the same on multi-slot auctions, so that you can repost them the second someone buys them.</li>
  <li>'Mystery boxes' must have some uniqueness to them or indication of what's inside.</li>
  <li>There is decent effort put into them. Recoloring some things to get around the ‘not identical’ rule, or doing extremely rough sketches may be removed for quality assurance.</li>
  <li>For adoptables, you cannot post more than 3 auctions using the same base at the same time. This includes “mystery boxes".</li>
  <li>Posting the same auction in multiple categories<mark class="pen-red"> </mark>is considered spam.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2.6 The scoring system</h2>
<p>The scoring system on Commishes is a way for users to like or dislike auctions they find. Auctions which are upvoted more show up higher on the list.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Voting for an auction positively or negatively because a person, group or collective told you to in return for money, advertisement, or upvotes for your own auctions is prohibited and if found will result in a permanent ban.</li>
  <li>Voting on your own auctions from a separate account or accounts will result in a ban on all accounts.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2.7 Interacting with admins</h2>
<p>We try to ensure all interactions with staff are pleasant and succinct. We understand current circumstances may be stressful or frustrating. Please be kind to our staff and we will help you as best as we're allowed. To help us and by extension yourself, please take into account several rules when interacting with staff:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Do not message a moderator or admin in PM directly unless asked, they will likely ignore the message or could potentially not see it.</li>
  <li>If you feel a moderator is treating you unfairly, you may ask to speak with someone higher up the ladder than them. We take complaints against staff seriously, and will investigate accordingly. This almost never results in bans being lifted sooner except in extreme circumstances.</li>
  <li>Interacting with staff through instant messaging such as Telegram and Discord is a <i>privilege</i>. You may be banned from these chats if you refuse to follow the rules of the chat or become unruly. Your main method of communication with staff then becomes email, which is much slower and generally much less preferable.</li>
  <li>When talking about an auction, account, or private message, please provide a link to the page in question for faster assistance.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2.8 Appealing bans</h2>
<p>Bans occasionally serve as warnings that can be waived. There are some things to consider when attempting to appeal a ban:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Appealing a ban is not guaranteed in any way. Complaining about an appeal not going through may result in a longer ban.</li>
  <li>If this is your first ban and it's not for something extreme, as long as you are kind to the staff and show that you understand what you did wrong and why it broke the rules, we are allowed to lift the ban prematurely. This usually only happens for 24 hour bans.</li>
  <li>If your ban message says “contact staff” or similar, it's a permanent ban which can likely be lifted by simply contacting staff with more information. This usually happens if we suspect your account is an imposter, or you have many auctions you have to finish.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2.9 Ban lengths and the incremental strike punishment system</h2>
<p>Bans come in multiple lengths and severities. Worse offenses jump further up in length. Multiple offenses will make your bans longer. These are the usual ban lengths we impose:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>24 hour: </strong>24 hour bans are usually for small offenses and first time offenses</li>
  <li><strong>72 hour:</strong> 3-day bans are usually for second offenses or worse offenses like tagging porn as safe. Your running auctions may or may not be canceled. Promotions can be reapplied to a new auction if you ask an admin.</li>
  <li><strong>1-week:</strong> 1 week bans are for multiple offenses or very bad offenses. These will almost always cancel your running auctions. Promotions can be reapplied to a new auction if you ask an admin.</li>
  <li><strong>2-week:</strong> This is generally the ‘final warning’ length. For larger offenses or multiple of the same offense. Your running auctions will be ended, and you will lose your promotions.</li>
  <li><strong>Permanent:</strong> For when you never get the memo and we believe the site will be safer without you. This is also the go-to length when we believe you are an illegitimate artist either stealing artwork or tracing. We also use this if you must contact administration before regaining control of your account. If this is the case, we will say so in the ban message.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2.10 Account names and social links</h2>
<p>To keep clients and artists safe on the site, we implement loose restrictions on your account names and socials that you link.</p>
<ol>
  <li>If you link any other social media, try to link back to YCH on at least one of your other socials so we can verify you are in fact the artist and not an impersonator. This isn't required, but helps you if your legitimacy is called to question.</li>
  <li>Do not name yourself something mistakenly close to another artist, this may result in a permanent ban until you prove your legitimate use for the name.</li>
  <li>Do not name yourself something vulgar or provocative. Names must be safe.</li>
</ol>
<h2>2.11 The rules are mutable</h2>
<p>These rules are new and subject to change with new information. As we discover how best to monitor and moderate the site, we will change these rules as needed to provide a smoother experience for users. If you have feedback, please feel free to share it with admins. Rules will generally not be retroactively enforced, but may be in rare cases.</p>
<h1>3. Running an auction</h1>
<p>When posting a new auction to Commishes, please make sure that your submission meets the following criteria:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It must be owned by you. You must be able to transfer the ownership to the buyer</li>
  <li>It must be priced appropriately. Offering artwork with artificially inflated prices is not allowed.</li>
  <li>You must be willing to sell the good or product you're offering.</li>
</ol>
<h2>3.1 The preview image</h2>
<p>The preview image helps users get an understanding of what they're bidding on. We've found that pastel colored characters catch the eye the best. Please follow these rules when uploading your preview image:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The preview must be your own artwork entirely. Traced, stolen or morphed artwork, even partially, will result in a ban. Likely permanently. This doesn't apply to adoptables, see <i>4. Adoptables.</i> This also doesn't necessarily apply to bases. See <i>3.7 Using Bases</i></li>
  <li>Any objects or anatomy included in the preview is assumed to be able to be added to the final picture free of charge unless the image itself states otherwise. This includes wings, tails, clothes, backgrounds, etc. This does not include shading.</li>
  <li>While you can offer any species for the client in the description, any characters in the image must match the category the auction is posted in.</li>
  <li>The starting bid/minimum increment/autobuy on the auction preview image does not need to match what you set in the settings. The price you set on-site override the auction image itself and must be honored.</li>
  <li>Auction image must not be epilepsy-inducing if animated.</li>
  <li>The auction preview may not have multiple adopts in the same picture. Please crop it to only the one you'd like to sell or are selling.</li>
</ol>
<h2>3.2 Description requirements</h2>
<p>The description is where all of your most vital information goes. Please be very careful with it, as it is the main cause for concern on many reports.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Any links in your description must match the rating of the auction as viewed from an incognito browser. If we open a link from your description in incognito and we can see explicit material without having to log in or verify age, your auction must also be marked as explicit. This means that sites such as Furaffinity, Inkbunny, and Deviantart are almost always okay to link.</li>
  <li>Any edits or add-ons you offer in the description must match the rating of the auction. If your preview image is safe, but you offer explicit as an edit, goal, or add-on, your auction must be marked as explicit.</li>
  <li>Because the description is much easier to edit than the image, if you decide to put the starting bid in your description then it must match the set starting bid of the auction. We advise not putting the SB in the description.</li>
  <li>Please list the method of payment you accept in the description ahead of time.</li>
  <li>If you are hosting the auction on other sites, you must link where else the auction is taking place. See <i>3.8 Allowing bids off-site</i></li>
  <li>You must follow the rules in<i> 3.7 Using bases</i> if posting artwork that uses a base.</li>
</ol>
<h2>3.3 Description defaults</h2>
<p>Some artists neglect to include all necessary information when posting auctions. To avoid arguments about what is expected by default, assume the below applies to all auctions unless the artist says otherwise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that you as an artist can overwrite these rules by defining or linking your own rules in the description. <strong>We highly suggest you change these in your description to tailor the TOS to your needs and abilities, as you and the client will be held accountable to them.</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Complex characters impose an extra fee.</li>
  <li>Adding limbs such as wings, adding/removing clothes, or other special requests imposes an extra fee.</li>
  <li>Keeping the finished picture private imposes an extra fee.</li>
  <li>Characters must reasonably fit within the provided example body type and proportions.</li>
  <li>Character must be same species as provided example image.</li>
  <li>Auction is unique and will not be resold unless it uses a base .</li>
  <li>Final image will be at same quality of preview image.</li>
  <li>Payment is up-front</li>
  <li>Payment is via PayPal Goods &amp; Services in USD</li>
  <li>Client must have a reference image or sheet of their character available at the time of purchase.</li>
  <li>If the auction detail is above a sketch level, a sketch may or may not be provided for critique before the rest is finished.</li>
  <li>If no WIP is provided and approved, then it's assumed that reasonable changes can be made to the final image.</li>
  <li>No other revisions or unmentioned alterations are included for free.</li>
  <li>Any characters in the image that do not have a separate slot auction running for them, or are said to be taken already, are assumed to be able to be chosen by the winner.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.4 Starting bid</h2>
<p>The starting bid is the minimum amount you are willing to take for the auction</p>
<ol>
  <li>Setting a lower starting bid and turning down offers at or above your starting bid will get you banned for false advertising.</li>
  <li>Bidding on your own auction or having a friend bid for you to raise your starting bid is not allowed. This will lead to the auction being canceled and every involved account being suspended. Promotions will be lost.</li>
  <li>Your description must match your starting bid, if you decide to put your SB in the description.</li>
  <li>Your starting bid, and all subsequent bids, are in USD</li>
</ol>
<h2>3.5 Sales &amp; Promotions</h2>
<p>Sales are a way to restart an auction with a boost in visibility. In return, you agree to accept a lower starting bid. The new starting bid is shown to you in advance, relisting an auction as a sale is an agreement that you are willing to accept this new amount if someone were to bid it. Because the new sale price acts as the new starting bid, all the rules in <i>3.4 Starting bid</i> apply to it.</p>
<h2>3.6 Alternative uses for auctions</h2>
<p>Auctions are not necessarily just for YCH's, there are several other uses allowed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Offering a fixed-price commission slot (By setting the starting bid and autobuy the same)</li>
  <li>Auctioning a commission slot to the highest bidder (Bidder must only pay their bid price)</li>
  <li>Adoptables</li>
  <li>Custom-made arts &amp; crafts</li>
  <li>Selling a base that you yourself made, for the winner to use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that these uses are not allowed:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Raffles, for free or for a commission slot.</li>
  <li>Auctions where each bidder gets a slot.</li>
  <li>‘Competitions’ where users fight to be the highest bidder but get the auction for free or a set price.</li>
  <li>Auctions purely for advertising anything.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.7 Using bases</h2>
<p>Bases are allowed to be used under several conditions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You must state in the description that it is a base.</li>
  <li>You must link to where others can find or buy the base.</li>
  <li>The base must explicitly say that it is for commercial use.</li>
  <li>You are fully responsible if the base you use is traced, stolen, or breaks a rule some other way. Use trusted base sources.</li>

<h2>3.8 Allowing bids off-site/crossposting</h2>
<p>You may host your auction on multiple sites at once so long as you follow several rules:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You must bid on your own auction to match the bids from other sites. <i>If you are too slow or not available, and someone on ych.commishes wins instead of your own bid, you must sell it to them.</i> This is the responsibility you take for hosting it in several places. Ghosting or refusing to sell to a client who won on this site because someone bid higher elsewhere and you didn't update their bid here will get you banned.</li>
  <li>You must link all other places that you are holding the auction in the description. These places must be publicly accessible so admins can verify you're not trying to cheat the system.</li>
</ol>
<h2>3.9 Terms of service</h2>
<p>It is your full responsibility to disclose how you run your artistic business to your clients. You should make clear several things to ensure nothing can blindside you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Whether you take payment up front, after sketch, or at the end. By default, up-front payment is expected.</li>
  <li>Whether you allow refunds before beginning work. By default, payments are non-refundable so long as the artist maintains contact with the client.</li>
  <li>Whether you allow full or partial refunds after having worked on the picture for a bit. By default, payments are non-refundable.</li>
  <li>Whether you post your art publicly or not. By default, all completed art is assumed public.</li>
  <li>Whether you allow edits of the sketch or not. By default, a single round of minor edits are allowed to better fit the client's wishes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>3.10 Surcharges</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Artists may not impose a global surcharge to auctions they run, regardless of payment type. <i>Bidders may only be expected to pay the price they bid</i> and nothing more, assuming their request meets the rules of the auction description. <i>This includes PayPal and transaction fees.</i> Forcing a client to pay more for any reason other than at the client's request for additional work will result in a ban.</li>
  <li>Artists are allowed to charge more for any changes to the base auction that were not directly specified, within reason. This includes but is not limited to extra edits, changes in species or body type, clothing options, privacy, expedited processing, additional characters, changes to the sketch beyond the first revision, etc.</li>
  <li>Artists are allowed to offer incentives, goals, and upgrades for their auctions if explained concisely in the description. Please note all upgrades <i>must be optional</i>. For example. Add shading for +$20, add a second character for +$40, use a character with wings for +$10, if the bidding goes past $60 you unlock flat color instead of a sketch, etc.</li>
</ol>
<h1>4. Adoptables</h1>
<h2>4.1 Using bases</h2>
<p>Base adoptables are allowed so long as they follow the general auction guidelines under <i>3.7 Using bases.</i></p>
<h2>4.2 Enforcing arbitrary adopt rules</h2>
<p>Commishes does not and will not side with the artist of an adoptable with arbitrary adoption rules. This means that while you may state in your description what the buyer is/isn't allowed to do with the adoptable, there are some things to keep in mind:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Adoptables are non-refundable from either side. The artist <i>can not</i> refund the buyer in order to ‘take back' the adoptable. The buyer <i>can not</i> ask for a refund on the adoptable unless a rules was broken by the artist the buyer wasn't aware of.</li>
  <li>You can list your rules in the description, but the only thing you can do if someone breaks them is ban them from buying from you again, or warn others on your social media. You cannot retcon the character and take them back, we will not punish them on the site for any reason. <i>We believe the buyer fully owns the character and can do absolutely anything they want with it.</i></li>
  <li>If you resell a character you sold to someone else before for any reason (other than buying it back from them at their agreement), you will be banned.</li>
</ul>
<h2>4.3 Reselling and proving ownership</h2>
<p>Reselling is allowed on Commishes, but be prepared to show proof if asked. In general, you must follow these rules about reselling and proving your ownership:</p>
<ol>
  <li>State in the description that you are not the original artist, the original artist's name, and who you bought it from (if they're different).</li>
  <li>If you sell a character that you bought from another artist, include a link to the auction / sale page so an admin can verify your ownership</li>
  <li>You must have a watermark of some kind on your preview image of the adoptable, to prevent people from stealing it, we recommend using your username.</li>
  <li>If the username on your adoptable watermark is not obviously yours or close, you may be banned for stealing until you contact an admin to sort it out.</li>
</ol>
<h2>4.4 Copyright infringement</h2>
<p>We believe there are many ways to be creative, but stealing from others is not one of them. We enforce several rules about what is acceptable fair use when selling adoptables:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You cannot use the name of a copyrighted product in your character's name.<mark class="pen-red"> </mark>For example “Tide Pod pony”, or “Coca Cola bunny”.</li>
  <li>You cannot use a copyrighted product or logo in your adoptable preview image, even if the character is based off that product or is from that media. Simply say so in the description.</li>
  <li>You cannot sell any original character designs you don't own. This also includes other people's OC's. This includes heavy reference. If your character looks ‘too much’ like another original character, at admin's discretion, your auction will be removed and action possibly taken against you. F.e. selling a nightfury OC is totaly okay, but it can't be an OC based on toothless or show the same traits.</li>
  <li>Species (characters that have many copies in their original media) are fine to make adopts from. This includes things like Pokemon, hellhounds, mlp ponies, centaurs, etc.</li>
  <li>Commishes does not recognize closed species as a defensible property and will not, at this time, delete auctions selling them ‘illegally’ so long as the character is unique.</li>
</ol>
<h1>5. Bidding on an auction</h1>
<h2>5.1 Process to retract a bid</h2>
<p>If you bid on an auction accidentally or bid an incorrect amount, these are the steps you should take, in this order, to try and retract the bid. Please note that if both steps fail,<i> you will have to pay what you bid or face a false bid ban</i>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, contact the artist. Artists are understanding and many will remove the bid for you without a problem.</li>
  <li>If they can't be reached or refuse, contact an admin. Please note that <i>admins can only delete bids if it is obviously a typo.</i> For example, if the bids are 10, 20, 30 and you bid 400, it's obviously a typo. But if you bid 40, we would not remove that.</li>
</ol>
<h2>5.2 Responsibility to pay</h2>
<p>If you win an auction, and for any reason decide to not pay the artist or quit responding, you will likely receive a permanent ban. This ban will be lifted if you contact admins and arrange a meeting with the artist to sort things out.</p>
<p>You are never required to pay more than the bid amount assuming your character and request fit within the terms and guidelines of the auction. See <i>3.3 Description defaults</i></p>
<h2>5.3 Auction sniping</h2>
<p>Auction sniping is fully allowed. Refusing to sell to someone who sniped an auction you neglected to put anti-snipe on is grounds for action taken against your account. Enable sniping protection on your auction if you are concerned about this.</p>
<p>If you are a bidder, feel free to comment on the auction asking for anti-snipe to be turned on if it isn't already.</p>
